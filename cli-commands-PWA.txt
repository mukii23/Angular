** CLI commands for Progressive Web Apps (PWA) **
*****/

First build the Project with

=: ng build --prod
 After use of this command a folder name 'dist' will be created under the project like i.e 'dist/project-name'
 The production will be available from this folder. We can use a tool like http-server on this folder by
 
=: npm i -g http-server

  You can then run this server by..
  
=: cd dist/project-name
=: http-server -o

Now the PWA will be available on http://127.0.0.1:8080/
To check the PWA in chrome open the above link. After that open the 'Developers Tool'
Audits>> 'Check th progessive web app' and press run audits button
